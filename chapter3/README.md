# Chapter 3: Control Flow

This chapter covers the control flow statements in C, which determine the order in which program statements are executed.

## Topics Covered
- Statements and Blocks
- If-Else
- Else-If
- Switch
- Loops and While
- For
- Do-While
- Break and Continue
- Goto and Labels

## Exercises
1. Our binary search makes two tests inside the loop, when one would suffice. Write a version with only one test inside the loop
2. Write a function escape(s,t) that converts characters like newline and tab into visible escape sequences like \n and \t as it copies the string t to s
3. Write a function expand(s1,s2) that expands shorthand notations like a-z in the string s1 into the equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2
4. In a two's complement number representation, our version of itoa does not handle the largest negative number. Modify it to print that value correctly
5. Write the function itob(n,s,b) that converts the integer n into a base b character representation in the string s
6. Write a version of itoa that accepts three arguments instead of two. The third argument is a minimum field width
7. Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the character string s
8. Write a function expand(s1,s2) that expands shorthand notations like a-z in the string s1 into the equivalent complete list abc...xyz in s2
9. In a two's complement number representation, our version of itoa does not handle the largest negative number. Modify it to print that value correctly
10. Write the function itob(n,s,b) that converts the integer n into a base b character representation in the string s
