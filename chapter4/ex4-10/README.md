# Exercise 4-10

An alternate organization uses `getline` to read an entire input line; this makes `getch` and `ungetch` unnecessary. Revise the calculator to use this approach.

## Description
This program is a revised version of the reverse Polish notation calculator such that it reads entire lines of input rather than one character at a time.

## Compilation

To compile, use:
```bash
gcc solution.c -o solution
```

## Running

After compilation, run the program:
```bash
./solution
```
