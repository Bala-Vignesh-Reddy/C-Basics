# Chapter 5: Pointers and Arrays

This chapter covers pointers and arrays, which are fundamental to C programming and provide powerful ways to manipulate data.

## Topics Covered
- Pointers and Addresses
- Pointers and Function Arguments
- Pointers and Arrays
- Address Arithmetic
- Character Pointers and Functions
- Pointer Arrays; Pointers to Pointers
- Multi-dimensional Arrays
- Initialization of Pointer Arrays
- Pointers vs. Multi-dimensional Arrays
- Command-line Arguments
- Pointers to Functions
- Complicated Declarations

## Exercises
1. Write a function getint that performs free-format input conversion by breaking a stream of characters into integer values
2. Write getfloat, the floating-point analog of getint
3. Write a pointer version of the function strcat that we showed in Chapter 2
4. Write a function strend(s,t), which returns 1 if the string t occurs at the end of the string s, and zero otherwise
5. Write versions of the library functions strncpy, strncat, and strncmp, which operate on at most the first n characters of their argument strings
6. Rewrite appropriate programs from earlier chapters and exercises with pointers instead of array indexing
7. Write a program to find all lines matching a pattern
8. Write a program to print a set of files, starting each new one on a new page, with a title and a running page count for each file
9. Write a program to print a set of files, starting each new one on a new page, with a title and a running page count for each file
10. Write a program to print a set of files, starting each new one on a new page, with a title and a running page count for each file
