## Exercises
1. Run the "hello, world" program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.
2. Experiment to find out what happens when printf's argument string contains \c, where c is some character not listed above.

4. Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table.
5. Modify the temperature conversion program to use a function for conversion.
6. Verify that the expression getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1.
7. Write a program to print the value of EOF.
8. Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.
9. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.
